# Kira-Plastina-Unsupervised-learning-R-Programming-Customer-Characteristics-prediction
Defining the problem
A business’s performance relies on its ability to balance its supply with the current demand. Kira Plastina is a Russian chain retail stores that has expanded across some countries. Its huge customer base has over the years influenced its revenues prompting them to hire a data scientist to investigate customer characteristics.  
Experimental Design
This are the steps i shall incorporate: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Modelling, Conclusion and Recommendation. The metrics of success will rely on K-NN, Hierarchical Clustering models  

Data Source 
The dataset (http://bit.ly/EcommerceCustomersDataset), contains 18 columns, 10 numerical and  8 categorical attributes. The dataset contains variables split into the following customer characteristics:
1.	Bounce Rate, Exit Rate and Page value represent customer behaviors collected from a Google characteristic. They represent triggers collected from a customer’s view on a page regardless of the time spent.
2.	Exit Rate and Page Value represent the value of a webpage via customer interaction. Exit Rate calculates the percentage from the last session whereas page value symbolizes the actual time spent by customer before making a transaction.
3.	"Administrative", "Administrative Duration", "Informational", "Informational Duration", "Product Related" and "Product Related Duration" represents the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and total time spent in each of these page categories. 
4.	Special Day represents special Occasions such as X-mass, increasing the number of visits. The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between the order date and delivery date.
5.	The dataset also includes the operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type as returning or new visitor, a Boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is weekend, and month of the year.
